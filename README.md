# My-Family-Newsletter
# My-Demo

### I created this Family Newsletter project because my mom sends a weekly newsletter to all of our friends and family

### I used javascript, express, cors, as well as node

# My Features 
I had a login page that when you type in the incorrect password it would give you an error but if you have the correct password it would take you to the homepage. On the homepage you could add text as well as an image. You could also delete previous posts. Since I had it running on the server if you refresh it wont delete what you post unless you restart the server.
